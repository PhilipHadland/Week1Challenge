# Week1Challenge
What was the challenge?

The challenge was to plan user stories and epics for a cinema website with a set criteria of what the client required the website to do.


How I expected the challenge to go.

Going into the challenge I was very unsure of how it would go because I'd never written full user stories and acceptance criteria for a project before. However, I did feel confident I knew how to write these because of the training we'd received this week and also from the articles on the training site.


What went well?

I think I've covered all the required features and based on the user stories it clear what needs to be built. It's also opened my eyes to how many different things need to be thought of when building a website.


What didn't go as planned?

I started off by completing the user stories and then created the EPICs after, fitting in the user stories where I felt they needed to be. In hindsight I should've started off with a clear EPIC and worked on the user stories alongside these. I can see that the I could've split the user stories up into more EPICs, and as part of the acceptance criteria make sure they correspond with a user story. 

As part of additional features, I've made sure to follow a better format with a clearer EPIC and I think this a better approach. Although how I done it initially didn't go to plan, I'm happy that it didn't because I've learn't a more effective way as a result.

Possible improvements for future challenges.

Not an improvement as such but it would be good if we continued with the same theme of building this cinema website, then we can implement what we learn each week into the build.
